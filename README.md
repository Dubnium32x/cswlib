# cswlib
## A rewrite of cwlib in C#

This does NOT recreate the entirety of Craftworld Toolkit. Rather it is a replica of the library files found in the toolkit
software, as well as files that were once used in LBP itself, but now in C#.

This will allow others, including but not limited to Craftworld HUB, to be able to use LBP libraries within Unity and Godot
at their leisure. Please go support the original authors of the code.

## What you can gain from this:
### Making better LittleBIGPlanet fan games
The most obvious is being able to use what Alex Evans describes as the "LBP Method" in an LBP fan game. You'll get more bang for your buck for level versioning, loading, detailing, and more.
### Learning Serialization
Much like this project was for us to make, you will learn how the serialization and revisioning works for your own indie projects if you decide to go that route too.
### Understanding the LBP File Data to a T
Simply put, if you have more experience in C#, you'll understand how LBP works more than what you can gain out of Toolkit alone.
